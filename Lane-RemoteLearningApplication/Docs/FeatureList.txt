- Develop or find a code base for writing 2 dimensional associative array to a text file OR excel file OR xml file for download

Download file, bring to excel and create graph, wants to be able to choose excel, text or xml. If you can do in JS rather than PHP that's fine. On some level better to do on client side, so consider JS. Doesn't matter which, but wants user to be able to download file and choose formats. At a minimum, comma seperated value as we can bring that to excel. XML would be nice because Eva's file needs it. Basically do it all is the implication here.

Build sample code, test and make sure functionality is working. Write a document that says what we need to do like framework, how to include framework files on server for Joseph Colton. 
1. Get it working on machine, 
2. Write sample code for proof of concept, 
3. Documentation for others 
4. Design a page that would (more later)
